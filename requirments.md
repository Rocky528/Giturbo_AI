# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for AiCoder Integration with Langchain-Java

## 1. Introduction

The goal of this project is to integrate the AiCoder application with the Langchain-Java GitHub repository. AiCoder is an AI-powered application that assists with code review, issue handling, and pull request management. The integration will enable AiCoder to interact with the Langchain-Java repository, providing automated assistance to developers.

## 2. Features

### 2.1 Code Review

AiCoder will be able to perform code reviews on pull requests in the Langchain-Java repository. The application will automatically review the changes and leave a comment with the result. This feature will be triggered by adding a specific label (e.g., "AiCoder:review") to the pull request.

### 2.2 Issue Handling

AiCoder will be able to handle issues in the Langchain-Java repository. When an issue is created and assigned to AiCoder (by adding a specific label, e.g., "AiCoder:create"), the application will generate an implementation plan and comment on the issue with the plan. If the plan is approved (by commenting "LGTM"), AiCoder will create a new pull request to implement the changes described in the issue.

### 2.3 Pull Request Management

AiCoder will be able to manage pull requests in the Langchain-Java repository. After an implementation plan is approved, AiCoder will create a new pull request with the proposed changes. The pull request will include a summary of changes and will use the same style as the existing code in the Langchain-Java repository.

## 3. Integration

The integration with the Langchain-Java repository will involve setting up GitHub webhooks to trigger AiCoder's features. The webhooks will be configured to send events to AiCoder's server when specific actions occur in the repository (e.g., a new issue is created, a pull request is opened, a label is added to an issue or pull request).

## 4. User Interface

AiCoder will interact with users through comments on issues and pull requests in the Langchain-Java repository. The application will use prompts to guide its interactions and will respond to user commands (e.g., "LGTM" to approve an implementation plan).


## 4.1. Feature: Repository Structure Summarization and Visualization
Description:
When a user adds the label "initiate" to an issue or pull request in the repository, AiCoder will be triggered to generate a JSON file that summarizes the structure of the repository. The JSON file will include descriptions of classes, methods, and global variables in the repository.

In addition, AiCoder will generate a chart using D3.js to visualize the structure of the repository. The chart will represent the relationships between different components of the repository, such as classes, methods, and variables.

## 5. Future Enhancements

Future enhancements may include expanding AiCoder's capabilities to handle more complex tasks, such as merging pull requests, resolving merge conflicts, and providing more detailed code reviews.
